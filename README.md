Expressjs Architecture (MVC)
- express operates on an mvc architecture..
- MVC(Model, View, Controller)
- Model => the data storage
- Views handle requests from clients(browser, mobile app, standalone desktop apps, tv boxes, watches) === Devices accessing the API
- Controller handles the business logic (full brains of the api). When a request is sent, the controller calls on the model to do something. A controller ends up being a middle man between the view and the model
